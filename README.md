# TensorFlow Examples

This repo contains examples of TensorFlow typical usage, including tutorials and real-world examples.

Note that this repo is based on `python 3.6.5`, since currently `python 3.7.0` is still not compatible with TensorFlow.

Therefore, please either

* degrade down to `Python 3.6.5` via `brew switch python 3.6.5_1` in the standard environment;

* or create a virtual environment (`virtualenv`) with `python 3.6.5`

to run the examples in this repo.
